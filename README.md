# Gaming Picotron Distribution
An attempt to make a SteamOS/PS3-like distribution for Picotron.

## Current development status (as of 20:42, 17/12/2025)

Will be setting this up to work fully controller & fully mouse in future

Custom thin primary font

Uses a wallpaper from `/appdata/system/gaming/settings.pod`

XMB menu:

* controller only
* swap distributions (in system - distro is temporary, boot into bios to permenantly change the distribution, stops controller-only devices from locking themselves)
* enter game menu (all games is only working option)
* reboot button (in system)

Game menu:

* mouse only
* displays first 8 games in `/games`
* lets you open games
